## They belong to a dataset publically available on GEO (gene expression omnibus) under the ID GSE175844
### The study is named "Identification of KLF4 regulated transcriptional features in breast cancer"

[***Note***]: In my case, I downloaded the GSE175844_RAW.tar file **which contain the samples .CEL files*** from the geodatabase but it can't be uploaded due to size limitation

[***Alternative approach***]: You can use the matrix directly from the Series Matrix File.txt file instead of using the affy package
